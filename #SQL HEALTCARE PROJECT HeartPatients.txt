#SQL HEALTCARE PROJECT on patients with heartdisease.
  

#1. Find the percentage of people with heart disease in each AgeCategory and Sex. Group the results by AgeCategory and Sex.

SELECT agecategory, sex,
ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN heartdisease = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS percentage_with_disease
FROM heart2020cleanedV2
group by agecategory, sex
ORDER BY agecategory desc;

modified ans below by adding alcohol drinking 

SELECT  agecategory, sex, alcoholdrinking,
ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN heartdisease = 'Yes' AND alcoholdrinking = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS percentage_with_disease
FROM heart2020cleanedV2
group by agecategory, sex, alcoholdrinking
ORDER BY agecategory desc;



#2. Identify the average BMI for individuals who engage in physical activity versus those who do not. Include the results grouped by Sex and GenHealth.

SELECT 
    physicalactivity, 
    sex, 
    genhealth, 
    AVG(bmi) AS AverageBMI
FROM 
   heart2020cleanedV2
GROUP BY physicalactivity, sex, genhealth;

modified ans below by adding where clause finding ans whose general health = FAIR

SELECT 
    physicalactivity, 
    sex, 
    genhealth, 
    AVG(bmi) AS AverageBMI
FROM heart2020cleanedV2
where genhealth = 'Fair'
GROUP BY physicalactivity, sex, genhealth;



#3. Determine the sum of patients who have heart disease and patients who smoke, also give avg of physical health, mental health, sleep time and  Group the results by AgeCategory and sex.

SELECT agecategory, sex,
SUM(CASE WHEN smoking = 'Yes' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS smokers,
SUM(CASE WHEN heartdisease = 'Yes' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS heart_patient,
AVG(physicalhealth) AS 	avg_physic,
AVG(mentalhealth) AS avg_mind,
AVG(sleeptime) AS sleepers
FROM heart2020cleanedV2
GROUP by agecategory, sex
order by agecategory asc;


#4. Analyze the relationship between Smoking, AlcoholDrinking, and GenHealth. Identify if there is a significant difference in general health between smokers and non-smokers, drinkers, and non-drinkers.

SELECT 
    smoking,
    alcoholdrinking,
    AVG(CASE 
        WHEN genhealth = 'Excellent' THEN 5
        WHEN genhealth = 'Very good' THEN 4
        WHEN genhealth = 'Good' THEN 3
        WHEN genhealth = 'Fair' THEN 2
        WHEN genhealth = 'Poor' THEN 1
        ELSE NULL
    END) AS avg_genhealth
FROM 
    heart2020cleanedV2
GROUP BY 
    smoking,
    alcoholdrinking
ORDER BY 
    smoking,
    alcoholdrinking;


#5. Investigate whether individuals with asthma are less likely to engage in physical activity. Compare this across different AgeCategory and Sex.  

SELECT agecategory, sex, physicalactivity,
    SUM(CASE WHEN asthma = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as asthma_patient
    FROM heart2020cleanedV2
    group by agecategory, sex, physicalactivity
    ORDER BY asthma_patient DESC;


#6. Find the PATEINT COUNT of chronic conditions such as Diabetic, KidneyDisease, and SkinCancer among different races. Group the results by Race and GenHealth.

  SELECT race, genhealth,
  SUM(CASE WHEN diabetic = 'Yes' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS number_of_diabetic,
  SUM(CASE WHEN kidneydisease = 'Yes' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS number_of_kid_disease,
   SUM(CASE WHEN skincancer = 'Yes' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS number_of_skin_cancer
    from heart2020cleanedV2
    GROUP by race, genhealth
    order by genhealth;
